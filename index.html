<h1>Welcome To Prague</h1>

<p>On a path less traveled, this blog will guide you to places that locals go to. Prague is a beautiful heritage city and people often get lost in the sea of tourists. They get swept in the direction of the crowd, get distracted by the river or by the lovely architecture.</p>

<p>While there is no harm in getting lost in the sights, there are many more places to explore and see in Prague. After all, going to places and doing things that have never been done is living.</p>

<p> Sit down with your cup of coffee and read about places in Prague where you can get a bite of the best or better still, a sip of the bitter-sweet.</p>
