<blockquote class="blockquote">Ask not what you can do for your country. Ask what's for lunch. - Orson Welles</blockquote>

<p> Prague is a great place for someone who is passionate about food. Since its also a tourist hub you will come across almost all popular international cuisine restaurants in the city center. A great way of enjoying a meal at a good price is the <b>Lunch Menu</b> or <em>Polední Menu</em> as its known in Czech. Its basically a soup and a main course. The price for this is generally in the range of 180 - 250 Kč.


Here are some suggestions for places you can head to for lunch in Prague</p>

<h2 class="section-heading"> 1. Restaurace U Jindřišské věže </h2>


<p>Situated right in the city centre this restaurant is a great location for lunches. 10 meters from the Tramstop Jindrisska, this mid sized restaurant packs a punch. This place can get quite busy because of its location. It offers Classic Czech Cuisine and the food is good and priced reasonably. In their lunch menu you can expect the famous goulash, svičkova, smaženy syr, the classics...

<h2 class="section-heading"> 2. Ferdinanda Pub, Novomēstka</h2>

<p>Not far from  U Jindřišské věže on Opletalova you will find this on a crossroad close to Hlavní Nadraži. Its more of a restaurant than a pub. It has two floors for seating. At times they can have their top floor closed for service. They offer Czech Cuisine with a twist. They also brew their own beer which goes by the same name as of the place.
I would reccomend the <em>jedenactku</em> along with smazney syr or goulash.

<h2 class="section-heading"> 3.Cafe Imperial </h2>

<p>Ok this one is a little expensive one. It has to be. The owner is a celebrity Chef. His name is Zdenek Pohlreich. He has a TV show and he tries to be like Gordon Ramsay. The show can be funny to watch but the food is straight yummy! The lunch menu makes it a bit more affordable.  </p>

<p>The classics are of course the goulash, the duck, the rabbit, the buchek ... man typing about these make me hungry. </p>

<h2 class="section-heading">The Final Frontier</h2>

<p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

<p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Reaching for the Stars</h2>

<p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

<p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

<p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
