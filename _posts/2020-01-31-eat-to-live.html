<blockquote class="blockquote">Ask not what you can do for your country. Ask what's for lunch. - Orson Welles</blockquote>

<p> Prague is a great place for someone who is passionate about food. Since its also a tourist hub you will come across almost all popular international cuisine restaurants in the city center. A great way of enjoying a meal at a good price is the <b>Lunch Menu</b> or <em>Polední Menu</em> or <em>Denni Menu</em> as its known in Czech. Its basically a soup and a main course. The price for this is generally in the range of 180 - 250 Kč. Also almost all places accept Sodexho Passes also known as Stravenky in CZ.


Here are some suggestions for places you can head to for lunch in Prague</p>

<h2 class="section-heading"> 1. Restaurace U Jindřišské věže </h2>


<p>Situated right in the city centre this restaurant is a great location for lunches. 10 meters from the Tramstop Jindrisska, this mid sized restaurant packs a punch. This place can get quite busy because of its location. It offers Classic Czech Cuisine and the food is good and priced reasonably. In their lunch menu you can expect the famous goulash, svičkova, smaženy syr, the classics... Link to their menu is <a href="https://u-veze.cz/en/">here.</a>[here]() and a link for the directions is <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/ZTnMVK5JU5DFFkL76">here.</a>


<h2 class="section-heading"> 2. Ferdinanda Pub, Novomēstka</h2>

<p>Not far from  U Jindřišské věže on Opletalova you will find this on a crossroad close to Hlavní Nadraži. Its more of a restaurant than a pub. It has two floors for seating. At times they can have their top floor closed for service. They offer Czech Cuisine with a twist. They also brew their own beer which goes by the same name as of the place. I would reccomend the <em>jedenactku</em> along with smazney syr or goulash. You can have look at their menu <a href="http://www.ferdinanda.cz/cs/nove-mesto/menu/denni-menu">here.</a> Click <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/WdqRjuuj9TXRR3fe8">here</a>for directions.

<h2 class="section-heading"> 3.Cafe Imperial </h2>

<p>Ok this one is a little expensive one. It has to be. The owner is a celebrity Chef. His name is Zdenek Pohlreich. He has a TV show and he tries to be like Gordon Ramsay. The show can be funny to watch but the food is straight yummy! We would reccomend reservations. The lunch menu makes it a bit more affordable. This would be a great place if you like posting photographs of food. Directions to the place can be found <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/7YVpwbdYqhXff7ci6"> here</a> and the  daily menu <a href="https://www.cafeimperial.cz/daily-menu/">here.</a> </p>

<h2 class="section-heading"> 4. Sangam </h2>

<p>Located in Karlin, which is more the business district and not the city center per se. They have some of the most authentic and colorful Indian food we have tasted. They shine with their lunch menu which changes daily. They also have vegetarian options. The staff is quite friendly and helpful, along with a calming ambience. Be cautious though, the food can be a bit spicy. Directions to the place can be found <a href="https://g.page/sangamprague?share">here</a> and their daily menu <a href="https://g.page/sangamprague?share">here.</a> </p>


<h2 class="section-heading"> 5. U Medvidku</h2>

<p>One of the larger and older restaurants this gem is located again right in the city centre. It was a brewery in the old days and now its also a hotel and a restaurant. Classic Czech cuisine will be served here. Its located near Narodni Trida and the exact location can be found here. The place is big and has a few entrances. Do not worry, all roads lead to rome in this case. Directions to the U Medvidku can be found <a href="https://g.page/UMedvidku?share"> here.</a> The daily menu can be found <a href="https://g.page/UMedvidku?share">here.</a> </p>
