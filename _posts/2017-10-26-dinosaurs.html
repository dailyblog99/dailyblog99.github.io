<p> Prague is a great place for someone who is passionate about food. From Korean delicacies to Canadian populars, you can truly find them all here. But since we are in Prague, lets find out what the locals like to eat and where do they for their grub. </p>

<h2 class="section-heading">What To Eat</h2>


<p>While at first glance one might feel that the Czech Cuisine is limited, you will be pleasantly surprised with the variety of dishes that are on offer. The cuisine would appear limited to you only if you do not eat meat. None the less, fear not ! There is something here for every one. Lets bite in ! </p>

<h3 class="section-heading">Soups</h3>

<p>Czech love soups and to be honest who doesnt ! They are healthy and filling and my personal go to dish in the winters. Soups also have a traditional place in Czech culture. During Christmas people are served soup as the first course of the dinner. Chances are you would be served a fish soup.</p>

<p>At home and at the work place, soups are often sought for.Soups are also a stron member of the <em>Lunch Menu Or Polední Menu.</em>
The soups that are on offer there will generally be broths and imported seasonal vegetables. Some classic czech soups are 
<ul>
	<li>Gulašova</li>
	<li>Spenatova</li>
	<li>Kvetakova</li>
</ul></p>

<h3 class="section-heading">Main Course</h3>

<p>Now that you are done with starters, lets munch on to the main course. Meat and potatoes are the foundation for this leg of the journey. Pork, Beef, Poultry all are used almost on a daily basis. The cost of the meat will determine the frequency of consumption in an average czech household. Rabiits are also available as are ducks. While all of this is there, you can aslo get reindeer meat during winters. </p>

<p>The classics are of course the goulash, the duck, the rabbit, the buchek ... man typing about these make me hungry. </p>

<h2 class="section-heading">The Final Frontier</h2>

<p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

<p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Reaching for the Stars</h2>

<p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

<p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

<p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
