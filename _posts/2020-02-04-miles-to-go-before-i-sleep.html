<p>In the begining one might feel that Prague while being a beautiful city is not the best city for walks. After all the cobblestones can get bumpy after a while and there hardly seems to be a place which is not on a slope or filled with tourists eager to capture you and your dog in their quest for the perfect selfie. While these realites do exist there also exist spacious places that are not frequented by tourists and where you can enjoy a nice walk all by yourself to clear the clutter in your head.</p>

<p>It goes without saying that all these places are much more enjoyable during summer, but hey! we can't hinbernate all winter, can we !?</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote"> While it is our endeavour to take you to places where there will be less of tourists and more of nature, we simply cannot gaurentee that you will be left 
all alone and will be able to attain nirvana.

<h2 class="section-heading"> Lets get walking! </h2>

<h3 class="section-heading"> Stromovka </h3>

<p> The largest park by far in the city, it is located in Hole≈°ovice. This park is so big that there are google locations for spots within the park. While it can seem packed in the summer, its size allows you to disappear and reappear in another corner of the park. You will come across all sorts of people here, mostly local and very few tourists. If you are lucky, you will be able to spot a couple of knights all geared up and preparing for a battle. You can easily lose yourself here so be careful to note the entry point or any other reference point you see fit for navigation. You can get directions to get to the part <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/eSB6CjkFXVoDiwzB6" target="_blank">here.</a> Please note, thee park is huge and if you have decided to meet your freinds there, please be clear as to where will you all meet. </p>


<h3 class="section-heading"> Regeirovy Sady</h3>


<p> A park with the prettiest view of the city, this park is located in Zizkov district of Prague. This park is best during summers when there is a functioning beer garden. For the rest of the year the park is a great place to exercise and enjoy beautiful sunsets over the city. The park is pretty popular amongs tourist and local expats. There is a spot there which is famous for Instagram photos. Often people can be noticed with picnic baskets enjoying an afternoon.</p>

<h3 class="section-heading"> Walking Path - Karlin To Staromestka</h3>

<p> A not so secluded path but a very enjoyable one. This path will take you from Karlin to Staromestka along the river. Of course you can choose to keep walking ahead from Staromestka towards Naplavka. This route is also famous for cyclists who use this to get to work in Karlin. The best time to enoy this patch is early mornings. </p>


<h3 class="section-heading"> Ladronka</h3>

<p> Located not far from the the city center in the direction of Nemocnice Motol, this park is a great place to walk or excercise. There will be mostly locals here and hardly any tourist. Since there will be locals there, you can safely expect a lot of dogs, a couple of cyclists and some really fit people. Should you feel depressed while looking at these fit people, you can head over to a cafe there for a quick coffee or better still head over to Kaufland which is next to it and shop till you drop. There is nothing better than <em>Retail Therapy.</em> You can find directions to Ladronka <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/FBnJFCiL4MhAfLZv7">here.</a></p>

<h3 class="section-heading"> Obora Hvezda</h3>

<p> Not far from Ladronka is Obora Hvezda. Back in the day when Charles IV was the man, this park or area was used as hunting grounds. Today it is a peaceful park which offers clean paths to walk on and a huge area to get lost in. It is a great place for running on trails since it was earlier a jungle. One of the least crowded parks in the list. Head over there if you want to be left alone walking on a dream. The best way to get there is by Metro. Head over to Petriny Metro Station, the park is a three minute walk from there. Detailed directions on reaching there can be found <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/PoqPkXmKhUAQuMxRA"> here.</a> </p>
