<p>How different can beer be ? Many would like to argue that in the end its just beer. I would argue the same if I was stuck in the middle of the desert and had not had a drop to drink. But since we are in Prague we can afford to be a little obnoxious about beer. The Czechs have been brewing beer since the begining of the 13th Century. Over the course of a couple of hundred years, Czech have more or less perfected the art of brewing and now are considered to be amongst the best, if not the best. Also</p>

<p>There can and will be another chapter on Czech Beer and why it is the best, till then let us at least show you the way to some of the places where you can decide for yourself. </p>

<p>Its true that in the begining you would feel that all beer is the same, but once you have spent enough time and drank to your hearts content, you will slowly realise that not all beers are the same, not all restaurants are the same in terms of the quality of the beer. Some are fine while others are excellent. Here are some top places that you can visit in Prague to quench your thirst. </p>

<blockquote class="blockquote"> Czech Beer is classified into four main categories based on the amount of alcohol they have.
<ul>
	<li>Desítku pronounced as you read it. This is the mildest variant.</li>
	<li>Jedenactku pronounced as Yedenactku. This is a little stronger than desítku and a popular choice amongst locals.</li>
	<li>Dvánactku pronouced as you read it. This is the most popular gradient. Pilsner Urquell is the most famous brand that sells this grade.</li>
	<li>IPA also known as Indian Pale Ale. This is the strongest of them all. Try at your own risk.</li>
	<li>Černy pronounced as Cherny. The CH needs to sound like Ch in Chair. This is black beer and can be tried for testing purposes.</li>
</ul>

The logic that we were told about the numbers ( 10, 11, 12....) is that if you were to divide the number by two, you will get the percentage of alcohol present in the beer.

<h2 class="section-heading"> Enough of logic. Lets get some beer !!</h2>

<h3 class="section-heading"> U Rudolfinum </h3>

<p>Located in Staromestka, this place is opposite Staromestka Tram Stop. We were reccomended this place by our friend. We were told that this place  serves the best beer in town. We couldnt agree more. The restaurant has seating spread between two floors. The food is not bad but the beer is simply the best. Directions to the place can be found <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/qybfxMynHEkd91SS9">here.</a>Their drinks menu can be found <a href="https://urudolfina.cz/napojak"> here.</a> </p>

<h3 class="section-heading"> U Kruhu </h3>

<p>This place is a hidden gem. It is right in the city centre but if you are not taken there, you will not know that it exists.</p>


<p>Situated in a building with a courtyard this is a cosy place where you can have a fun evening with your friends. The courtyard is perfect for the summer but you will be advised to be quiet so as to not disturb the neighbours. They serve the Pislner family and the staff is friendly and speaks english.  Directions to the place can be found <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/qv1R2vUEA8sKaJ486">here</a> and a link to their drinks menu <a href="https://www.prazdrojmenu.cz/u-kruhu/napojovylistek">here.</a> </p>

<h3 class="section-heading"> Deunde </h3>

<p> One of the coolest in the list, this little non descript bar is a real winner. Its been serving beer for the past twenty years and shows no sign of slowing down. They serve beer from the Bernard family. This is a nice place to meet locals. Ambient music is played indoors till 10 pm after which it is shut down since there are people who live above the pub. You can find the directions <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/epe9J8qCU35QPwcJ7">here</a> and a link to their drink menu <a href="https://www.barduende.cz/menu/">here.</a> </p>


<h3 class="section-heading"> Cafe Alternatif </h3>

<p> This little cafê is located near the National Meuzeum. It is a cosy hole in the wall and a perfect place to have an intimate conversation over a glass of beer. They host art exhibitions regularly and serve beer from the Bernard family. You can find the directions to get there <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/4RjBfRjwBzTanJYA8">here.</a> Unfortunately they do not have a menu online. The price for a large beer will be roughly 45Kč and they have a very limited food menu. </p>



<p> That is the list for now folks. Let us know if you liked the places that we reccomended or better still, if there is a place that you would reccomend to us. You can reach us at contact@placesinprague.com</p>

<p>We look forward to your suggestions !</p>
