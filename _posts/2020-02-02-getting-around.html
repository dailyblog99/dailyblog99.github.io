<p>A good measure of a city is the way its people move around. While traffic jams are not a rare sight, especially during roush hours, general public uses public transport as their primary mode of transport. Personal vehicles are used primarily on the weekends for a getaway.</p>

<p>Prague has a robust sytem of Buses, Trams, small boats and a growing Metro. Using all three or four you can reach any place in Prague, even if you have to cross a river.  This article is going to help you maximise the public transport in Prague.</p>

<p>Before we hop on we need to buy a ticket. Public administration has gone to great lengths to make tickets accessible for general public. <b>One ticket for the time it is valid can be used for all modes of transport.</b> We would sincerely reccomend visiting the <a href="https://www.dpp.cz/en">official website</a> for public transport. For detailed information on the kind of tickets and it's prices. please click <a href="https://www.dpp.cz/en/fares/fare-pricelist">here.</a>For information on where you can purchase tickets, please click <a href="https://www.dpp.cz/en/fares/list-of-points-of-sales">here.</a> Lastly, we would also reccomend that you download an application for your phone to search for connections. You can also purchase tickets via the app. Its called <em>Litačka</em> You can download the app <a href="https://app.pidlitacka.cz/en/">here.</a> </p>

<blockquote class="blockquote"> You need to get your ticket validated before you enter the Metro or step foot on a boat, or as soon as you enter the Tram or Bus. While you might feel that checking does not occur, common surpise checks during rush hour are a common sight. Checks can happen in any mode of transport.</blockquote>

<p>Before we travel further, lets have a look at the general timing of these modes of transport before looking at them in detail.
<ul>
	<li> Trams - 24 /7 </li>
    <li> Metro - 5 am till midnight</li>
    <li>Buses - 5 am till midnight. Some buses might behin their schedule at 4am.</li>
</ul></p>

<h2 class="section-heading"> Trams </h2>

<p>Trams are the only mode of public transport to operate through the night. trams play a very important role in getting people to places in Prague, especially at night.</p>

<p>Trams at night ply on the same route as they did during the day, the only change that happens is to their number. For example, number 9 becomes number 99/98 at night. The frequency also drops down a lot. During the day trams frequent every 3-7 minutes. This interval can increase to one tram every 30-45 minutes. This is where the application can help you get information on the tram at night.</p>

<p>Within the Tram network, there are a few that deserve a special mention. 
<ul>
	<li> Tram 22 - The historic route. Take this to get a glimpse of all things touristy.</li>
	<li> Funicular - Operates only at Petrin. This one is a super hit with kids. More information [here]()</li>
	<li> T3 Coupe - A special coupe designed locally has won design awards. More details on it can be found [here](https://t3coupe.com/)</li>
</ul>
</p>


<h2 class="section-heading"> Metro</h2>

<p>The backbone of Prague's public transport. Prague metro is punctual, clean and effecient. Currently it operates on three lines.
<ul>
	<li>Green Line Or A </li>

</ul></p>

<p>In all, there are roughly 48 metro stations in Prague. There is another metro line currently being built. It will be called the Blue Line Or D. It is scheduled to be completed by 2027. Till that time comes, we would like to share a lttle information on some interesting Metro Stations and what you can find around them.</p>
<ul>
	
	<li> Mustek - The largest amongst all of them, this one is situated at Wenceslas Square or locally known as Vaclavske Namesti. You will need a map of the station to not get lost. Commuters can change between the Green Line and the Yellow Line here.</li>

<p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Reaching for the Stars</h2>

<p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

<p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

<p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
