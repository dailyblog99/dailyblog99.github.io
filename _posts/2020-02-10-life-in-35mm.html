<p>Long before the malls with their multiplexes came to the city, Prague had its own cinema halls or better known as <em>Kino.</em> Littered across the city you can find single screen and/ or multi screen halls to suit your liking and timing.</p>


<blockquote class="blockquote">Marking its absence from the list will be your favourite neighbourhood multiplex.</blockquote>
	
<p> Within Prague chances of finding a Kino are the highest in and around the city center. In fact some of the best venues for film viewing  in Europe are in Pragueâ€™s city center. Almost all cinema halls have a bar and no film has an interval. With that being said , these are the top three places to go for a film.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading"> Magical Cinema Halls In Prague</h2>

<h3 class="section-heading"> Kino Lucerna</h3></p>

<p> Saying that this place is popular among the locals would be an understatement. The place has a connection with Vaclav Havel. If you do not know the guy, it's OK. If you are planning on flying to Prague, you will get to hear his name once again. If you live here, you know him. And if you are from Prague chances are you love him. </p>

<p>Kino Lucerna participates regularly in cultural events and shows films from around the world. Located at Wenceslas Square on a street called Spalena, you cannot miss this place. The cinema itself has three viewing halls and a restaurant. The place reeks of old world charm. If you end up watching a film from that era in this cinema, you will feel like you have time travelled. English films are also shown here. The closest tram stop is Vaclavske Namesti and the closest Metro station is Mustek. For further directions to this place, please click<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/AKV3XkipBQhZene69" target="_blank">here.</a>  For the programme of the cinema, please click <a href="http://www.kinolucerna.cz/" target="_blank">here.</a> </p>


<h3 class="section-heading">Kino Pon Repo</h3>

<p>This place is for film connoisseurs. In a lane near Narodni Trida this nondescript cinema is magic for film lovers. They often have international films. A small bar is present as there as well, one where you can sample local brew. We had a brew called <em>Kocour</em>, not bad at all.</p>


<p>So where is the magic ? The magic is when they show certain films in 35mm. It's a completely different movie experience, one that you would possibly not have experienced yet. It won't be a life changing one, don't expect to come out and turn water into wine. But you will hopefully come out with a smile. Do check the place out. The tram and metro station would be Narodni Trida on the Yellow Line. Directions to the place can be found <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/fFuNeWYAgm7H3NUn8" target="_blank">here.</a> The programme can be found <a href="https://nfa.cz/cz/kino-ponrepo/program/5/?d=2-2019" target="_blank">here.</a> If you are lucky they just might be having a free screening ! Yes, it happens - sometimes.</p>

<h3 class="section-heading">Kino Bio Oko </h3>

<p>This cinema hall is located in Holesovice and is popular amongst the art film going crowd. It regularly hosts film festivals and is frequented by students. This is a single screen cinema hall and the film watching experience is good. The seats are not your super soft plush chairs, they are good enough to hold your weight comfortably. More importantly chances are high that you will be lost in the images you see on the curtain. The best way to reach this place is by tram. The closest tram stop would either be Strossmayerovo Namesti. Directions to the cinema can be found <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/eUhK8KrhKgwhPpni7" target="_blank">here.</a> The programme schedule can be found <a href="https://www.biooko.net/" target="_blank">here.</a> </p>
