"Outside of a dog, a book is a man's best friend. Inside of a dog it's too dark to read." - Groucho Marx </blockquote>

<p>Little did good ol Groucho know of Prague, a place where a dog and a book get the same respect. While it is completely true that dogs enjoy another level of respect in CZ, books are not far behind. Not known to many, Czechs LOVE to read. We are not entirely sure as to where and how this habit was formed but are in complete awe of the libraries that are in Prague.</p>


<p> From baroque libraries to the new age National Technical Library, there is a variety of libraries to choose from. Not all of them operate till late hours but there are exceptions. Read on to find out more...</p>


<h2 class="section-heading"> Top Libraries in Prague


<h3 class="section-heading">National Library</h3>

<h4> <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/8zdMWtjEhzYA4oFJ6" target="_blank"> Location ></a></h4>

<p>The largest and the oldest library in Prague, this library exudes charm. Built by jesuits this library has stood the test of time and continues to provide a safe haven for all students to learn. This library is a complex of buildings and is hugely popular among tourists. The annual fee is 100 Kƒç , that's like two beers!
</p>

<p>The general study hall is big and can easily seat over a hundred students. The rule of silence is pretty strictly followed. General working hours are Monday to Saturday. The general study hall closes at 9pm where as other departments close a little earlier.</p>


<blockquote class="blockquote"> An interesting story about the library is captured in a film called "Oko Nad Prahou". It is a documentary about a Czech Architect who had won a competition to re design the library. A must watch ! You can find the link to the film  <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1417090/" target="_blank">here.</a> </blockquote>


<h3 class="section-heading"> Goethe Institue</h3>

<h4> <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/MvJ3TcD8qWWUTJuN7" target="_blank"> Location ></a></h4>

<h4> <a href="https://www.goethe.de/ins/cz/cs/index.html?wt_sc=cesko" target="_blank"> Official Website ></a></h4>


<p>Named after the famous German writer, this center conducts language classes and hosts cultural events. The centre also has a very nice library on the first floor. No guesses here that the collection is primarily in German and in Czech. However they do have a good collection of German Films. My personal recommendation would be Soul Kitchen by Fatih Akin. The library is meant more for cultural enrichment and hence does not have large seating space. Having said that, there is enough space to comfortably sit and read.</p>

<p>Another nice thing about this library is that they also have a collection of household items that you can borrow. From skateboards to camping equipment you can borrow these from the library.</p>

<p>If you have joined the insitute for language classes, membership to the library is free.The link to their library <a href="https://www.goethe.de/ins/cz/cs/index.html?wt_sc=cesko" target="_blank">here.</a> Unfortunately the web site is in German but the staff do speak English. </p>


<h3 class="section-heading"> National Technical Library</h3>

<h4> <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/c5gkAn8J79hqhFq27" target="_blank"> Location ></a></h4>

<h4> <a href="https://www.techlib.cz/en/" target="_blank"> Official Website ></a></h4>


<p>Located a little away from the city centre, this library is located in Dejvice in the University Campus. At first sight the building can be a little overwhelming but once you step in you can feel the energy all around you.  This library is OPEN TO ALL and FREE.</p>

<p>This library is open on Sundays and is also open till late at night. It can be a great place if you need to focus and study or read for long stretches of time.</p>

<h3 class="section-heading"> Library of Academy Of Sciences</h3>

<h4> <a href="https://g.page/knav-cz?share" target="_blank"> Location ></a></h4>

<h4> <a href="https://www.lib.cas.cz/en/" target="_blank"> Official Website ></a></h4>


<p>Located opposite Narodni Divadlo this is a busy library. While it is larger than the library at Goethe it can seem to be a little occupied. Students from all streams come here to catch up on their homework. This library is open only Monday to Friday. All the best in getting a seat there! The library has a collection of academic literature.</p>

<h3 class="section-heading"> Municipal Libary Of Prague</h3>

<p>As the name suggests, this is a city funded library. It has various branches spread across the city. These branches are small but serve the purpose well in providing space to the citie's residents for a quiet corner to read. The main library is located in Staromesta and is next to Clementinum. </p>

<p>Entrance and use of the library is free. Only if you wish to borrow do you have to apply for membership. The main library has a popular tourist attraction. The infinite tower of knowledge. Tourists generally come till the tower clicks a photo and returns. The serious people walk ahead and explore the library. There is a theatre in the basement which shows movies every Wednesday. These movies are generally the popular international ones or important documentaries. </p>
