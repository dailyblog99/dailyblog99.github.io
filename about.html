<p> My name is Jaroslav C. If you know me that is because you should know me. If you do not know me, chances are high that you live under a rock on an island in the Pacific Ocean. If you do not live under a rock on an island in the Pacific Ocean and you have access to the Internet ( well obviously you are here ) please search for me.  Chances are you might be related to me.</p>

<p>Many people have tried to explain my existence and tried to find reason for my genius. They will have to try harder. Many people have also tried to get me out of my  self-imposed exile. They too must try harder. </p>

<p>The only reason as to why I am writing this here is because of my good friend Digital P. Digital’s great grandfather who went by the name of Analog P,  was my student. At the time of inventing morse code, Analog fell ill. Unfortunately since I was busy with the invention I could not create the medicine in time. It took me exactly seven minutes to make the medicine but those seven minutes were too long for poor Analog. </p>

<p>Before moving on to the next dimension Analog made me promise that I would share my knowledge with one member of his family.  I made that promise to Analog  so that he could pass in peace. From that day on I would routinely examine each member of his family to find out who would best suited to pass on my learning.</p>


<p>I waited for generations till I found a young boy named Digital. He was Analog’s great grandson.</p>

<p>Impressed by his talent to learn and his desire to win and the fact that he cleared the test that none of his family members could,  proved to me without a shadow of doubt that Digital was the one.</p>

<p>From that day onwards Digital and I would communicate. Since the pigeons would take ages to deliver the messages I decided to invent the Internet. It only seemed logical after inventing the Morse Code. It was a little challenging but Tim helped me out, just a little bit. </p>

<p>Things got better once the Internet was set up. After that Digital requested me to help him write about Prague. A city where I was not born but a city where I am fondly remembered. I was almost elected as a President there. Since I have fond memories of Prague I decided to help Digital.</p>

<p>“It’s called a blog “ said  Digital. A blog ? The word that I had coined in the 19th century was “Magazine” and I still feel that it has more purpose, more meaning, more oomph, more character, more depth, more everything. Call it what you might, my other student William once said “What’s in a name” .  A blog,  a magazine, a newspaper, call it what you want, but please do show some love to Digital.</p>

<p> Till we meet again ....</p>


<p> J.C </p>
